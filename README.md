# Project 3 - Autocomplete

#### Deadline: Tuesday, 03/11, 9:30 am CST (before the lecture).

## Project Description
The description of the project can be found on the [class website](https://sites.google.com/uic.edu/cs-351/project-3-autocomplete). 

## Starter Code
Please note that there is **no starter code provided for this project**. 

## Commit/Push Policy
You **don't** need to regularly commit and push changes to your GitHub repository. You can commit and push the whole finished code to submit the project. However, it's a good practice and allows you to have a backup version of your code as well as helps to track what change broke or fixed your code. 

## Data files
All data files relevant to this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hk54xcwx6gjnzv2fcrqmn/ACFOO336YCGxkPz9MYpoHrY?rlkey=5lsd7a1fpw2oxcnwd0c7144mz&dl=0).

## Sample .gitignore file
This repo contains a **sample .gitignore file** along with this README file. A .gitignore file ignores whatever files you mentioned in it. That .gitignore has been set up to ignore **all .txt files**, so you won't push any large text files on to your GitHub repository.
